Once upon a time, deep in an ancient jungle called {Daji}, there lived a 
{animal}. This {animal} liked to eat {food} and {hausa_food} but it can 
not eat {hausa_food}. But the jungle had very little {food} to offer. One day an 
explorer named {explorer} found the {animal} and discovered it liked {food}. 
The {explorer} took the {animal} back to {city}, where it could eat as much {food} 
as it wanted. However, the {animal} became homesick, so the {explorer} brought it 
back to the jungle, leaving a large supply of {food}.

The End
