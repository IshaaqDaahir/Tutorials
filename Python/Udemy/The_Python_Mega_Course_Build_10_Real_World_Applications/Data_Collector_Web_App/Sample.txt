Purpose: ehlo() is used to identify the client (your script) to the SMTP server.
Details: It sends an EHLO (Extended Hello) command to the SMTP server. This is part of the SMTP protocol, which establishes communication between the client and the server.
Functionality:
EHLO checks the server's capabilities and informs it of the client's presence.
It is used to initialize the communication session.
The server responds with a list of features or extensions it supports (e.g., STARTTLS, AUTH, etc.).
Why It's Necessary:
The EHLO command is typically the first step in the SMTP conversation. Without it, the server might not recognize the client or establish a proper session. Some servers may allow communication with a basic HELO command, but EHLO is preferred because it supports extended SMTP capabilities.

How It Works in Your Code:
Connection Establishment: smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) creates a secure SSL connection to Gmail's SMTP server on port 465.
Identification with EHLO: gmail.ehlo() identifies your client to the Gmail SMTP server and ensures that the server is ready for further commands.
Login: After establishing the communication session, gmail.login(from_email, from_password) sends your credentials to authenticate the connection.
Message Sending: Finally, gmail.send_message(msg) sends the email.
In summary, ehlo() is a critical step to establish a proper SMTP session and to negotiate the server's extended features for email sending.
