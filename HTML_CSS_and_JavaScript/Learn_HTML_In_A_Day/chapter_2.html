        <p>This book focuses on the latest version of the language, popularly referred to as <mark>HTML5</mark>.
            There are two other versions you might encounter. These are HTML 4.01, the last major versions of the 
            language from December 1999 and a stricter version from 2000 called XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup 
            Language). XHTML is still very popular in some applications so important differences between it and
            <mark>HTML5</mark> will be called out in the text.</p>
